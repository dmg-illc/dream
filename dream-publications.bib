  abstract={Ambiguity resolution is key to effective communication. While humans effortlessly address ambiguity through conversational grounding strategies, the extent to which current language models can emulate these strategies remains unclear. In this work, we examine referential ambiguity in image-based question answering by introducing RACQUET, a carefully curated dataset targeting distinct aspects of ambiguity. Through a series of evaluations, we reveal significant limitations and problems of overconfidence of state-of-the-art large multimodal language models in addressing ambiguity in their responses. The overconfidence issue becomes particularly relevant for RACQUET-BIAS, a subset designed to analyze a critical yet underexplored problem: failing to address ambiguity leads to stereotypical, socially biased responses. Our results underscore the urgency of equipping models with robust strategies to deal with uncertainty without resorting to undesirable stereotypes.}

abstract={Image-based advertisements are complex multimodal stimuli that often contain unusual visual elements and figurative language. Previous research on automatic ad understanding has reported impressive zero-shot accuracy of contrastive vision-and-language models (VLMs) on an ad-explanation retrieval task. Here, we examine the original task setup and show that contrastive VLMs can solve it by exploiting grounding heuristics. To control for this confound, we introduce TRADE, a new evaluation test set with adversarial grounded explanations. While these explanations look implausible to humans, we show that they "fool" four different contrastive VLMs. Our findings highlight the need for an improved operationalisation of automatic ad understanding that truly evaluates VLMs' multimodal reasoning abilities.}

abstract={While human speakers use a variety of different expressions when describing the same object in an image, giving rise to a distribution of plausible labels driven by pragmatic constraints, the extent to which current Vision and Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) can mimic this crucial feature of language use is an open question. This applies to common, everyday objects, but it is particularly interesting for uncommon or novel objects for which a category label may be lacking or fuzzy. Furthermore, humans show clear production preferences for highly context-sensitive expressions, such as the quantifiers `few' or `most'. In our work, we evaluate VLLMs (FROMAGe, BLIP-2, LLaVA) on three categories (nouns, attributes, and quantifiers) where humans show great subjective variability concerning the distribution over plausible labels, using datasets and resources mostly under-explored in previous work. Our results reveal mixed evidence on the ability of VLLMs to capture human naming preferences, with all models failing in tasks that require high-level reasoning such as assigning quantifiers.}

 abstract = "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved performance across various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, the performance of LLMs has been shown to deteriorate over time, indicating a lack of temporal generalization. To date, performance deterioration of LLMs is primarily attributed to the factual changes in the real world over time. However, not only the facts of the world, but also the language we use to describe it constantly changes. Recent studies have indicated a relationship between performance deterioration and semantic change. This is typically measured using perplexity scores and relative performance on downstream tasks. Yet, perplexity and accuracy do not explain the effects of temporally shifted data on LLMs in practice. In this work, we propose to assess lexico-semantic temporal generalization of a language model by exploiting the task of contextualized word definition generation. This in-depth semantic assessment enables interpretable insights into the possible mistakes a model may perpetrate due to meaning shift, and can be used to complement more coarse-grained measures like perplexity scores. To assess how semantic change impacts performance, we design the task by differentiating between semantically stable, changing, and emerging target words, and experiment with T5-base, fine-tuned for contextualized definition generation. Our results indicate that (i) the model’s performance deteriorates for the task of contextualized word definition generation, (ii) the performance deteriorates more for semantically changing words compared to semantically stable words, (iii) the model exhibits significantly lower performance and potential bias for emerging words, and (iv) the performance does not correlate with cross-entropy or (pseudo)-perplexity scores. Overall, our results show that definition generation can be a promising task to assess a model’s capacity for temporal generalization with respect to semantic change."

To make progress in this direction, in this work we take a collaborative dialogue task as a testbed and study how model uncertainty relates to human uncertainty -- an as yet under-explored problem. We show that model uncertainty does not mirror human clarification-seeking behavior, which suggests that using human clarification questions as supervision for deciding when to ask may not be the most effective way to resolve model uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose an approach to generating clarification questions based on model uncertainty estimation, compare it to several alternatives, and show that it leads to significant improvements in terms of task success. Our findings highlight the importance of equipping dialogue systems with the ability to assess their own uncertainty and exploit in interaction."

Using a corpus of Dutch image descriptions with concurrently collected eye-tracking data, we explore the nature of the variation in visuo-linguistic signals, and find that they correlate with each other. Given this result, we hypothesize that variation stems partly from the properties of the images, and explore whether image representations encoded by pretrained vision encoders can capture such variation. Our results indicate that pretrained models do so to a weak-to-moderate degree, suggesting that the models lack biases about what makes a stimulus complex for humans and what leads to variations in human outputs.",

Inspired by psycholinguistic theories, we endow our speaker with the ability to adapt its referring expressions via a simulation module that monitors the effectiveness of planned utterances from the listener{'}s perspective. We propose an adaptation mechanism building on plug-and-play approaches to controlled language generation, where utterance generation is steered on the fly by the simulator without finetuning the speaker{'}s underlying language model.

Previous studies have shown that this also occurs at the semantic level for vague and context-dependent terms such as quantifiers and uncertainty expressions. However, work to date has mostly focused on passive exposure to a given speaker's interpretation, without considering the possible role of active linguistic interaction. In this study, we focus on gradable adjectives big and small and develop a novel experimental paradigm that allows participants to ask clarification questions to figure out their interlocutor's interpretation. We find that, when in doubt, speakers do resort to this strategy, despite its inherent cognitive cost, and that doing so results in higher semantic alignment measured in terms of communicative success. While not all question–answer pairs are equally informative, we show that speakers become better questioners as the interaction progresses. Yet, the higher semantic alignment observed when speakers are able to ask questions does not increase over time. This suggests that conversational interaction's key advantage may be to boost coordination without committing to long-term semantic updates. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms used by speakers to achieve semantic alignment and on how language is shaped by communication.},

In this study, we build on these approaches and focus on a higher-level dimension of language variation: speakers{'} age. We frame the task as a dialogue response generation, and test methods based on bag-of-words (BoW) and neural discriminators (Disc) to condition the output of GPT-2 and DialoGPT without altering the parameters of the language models. We show that Disc models achieve a higher degree of detectable control than BoW models based on automatic evaluation. In contrast, humans can partially detect age differences in BoW but not Disc responses. Since BoW responses are deemed better than Disc ones by humans, simple controllable methods thus appear to be a better tradeoff between adaptation and language quality. Our work confirms the challenges of adapting to higher-level dimensions of language variation. Moreover, it highlights the need to evaluate natural language generation thoroughly.",

This can happen at many levels of communication, including the tendency to code switch (CS), or change to another language. Alignment has often been considered the result of an unconscious automatic process that facilitates speakers' mutual understanding. In dialogues with a second language (L2) learner, alignment is constrained by the proficiency of the learner, and additional non-automatic processes will be at play, namely the individual pedagogical goals of learner and tutor. In this study, we investigate alignment in dialogues between Spanish/Catalan learners of English and their tutors. We analyse CS incidence, whether code switching can be explained as automatic alignment between speakers, and whether this is independent of other, non-automatic factors related to speakers’ goals. We find that alignment of code switching is present, varies with learner proficiency, and that code switching can additionally be triggered by lexical overlap and turn taking asymmetry, which we attribute to conscious pedagogical choices on the part of both tutor, at lower levels, and learner, at higher levels of student proficiency.}

    In this work, we explore whether large pre-trained contextualised language models, a common tool
    for lexical semantic change detection, are sensitive to such morphosyntactic changes. To this end,
    we first compare the performance of grammatical profiles against that of a multilingual neural
    language model (XLM-R) on 10 datasets, covering 7 languages, and then combine the two approaches
    in ensembles to assess their complementarity. Our results show that ensembling grammatical
    profiles with XLM-R improves semantic change detection performance for most datasets and languages.
    This indicates that language models do not fully cover the fine-grained morphological and syntactic
    signals that are explicitly represented in grammatical profiles. An interesting exception are the
    test sets where the time spans under analysis are much longer than the time gap between them
    (for example, century-long spans with a one-year gap between them). Morphosyntactic change is
    slow so grammatical profiles do not detect in such cases. In contrast, language models, thanks
    to their access to lexical information, are able to detect fast topical changes."

	We then evaluate them against the semantic judgements provided by human speakers. In line with previous evidence,
	we observe a generalized advantage of multimodal representations over language-only ones on concrete word pairs,

	align language and vision, which results in better semantic representations for concepts that are /grounded/ in images.
	On the other hand, models are shown to follow different representation learning patterns, which
	sheds some light on /how/ and /when/ they perform multimodal integration."

    has largely been limited to acoustic information related to voice and prosody. Detecting fine-grained
    linguistic properties of human dialogues is of crucial importance for developing AI- based conversational
    systems which are able to adapt to their human interlocutors. We therefore investigate whether, and to
    what extent, current text-based NLP models can detect such linguistic differences, and what the features
    driving their predictions are. We show that models achieve a fairly good performance on age- group prediction,
    though the task appears to be more challenging compared to discourse. Through in-depth analysis of the
    best models’ errors and the most predictive cues, we show that, in dialogue, differences among age groups
    mostly concern stylistic and lexical choices. We believe these findings can inform future work on developing
    controlled generation models for adaptive conversational systems."

    We also observe that speakers' choices are not oriented towards local uniformity of information,

    We focus on multi-word constructions at the lexical and morphosyntactic level, consider both first and second

We propose a generation model that produces referring utterances grounded in both the visual and the conversational context. To assess the referring effectiveness of its output, we also implement a reference resolution system. Our experiments and analyses show that the model produces better, more effective referring utterances than a model not grounded in the dialogue context, and generates subsequent references that exhibit linguistic patterns akin to humans.",

In particular, we propose the first approach to image description generation where visual processing is modelled sequentially. Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production.
