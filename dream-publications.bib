  abstract = "This study carries out a systematic /intrinsic/ evaluation of the semantic representations
	learned by state-of-the-art pre-trained multimodal Transformers.
	These representations are claimed to be task-agnostic and shown to help on many downstream language-and-vision tasks.
	However, the extent to which they align with human semantic intuitions remains unclear.
	We experiment with various models and obtain /static/ word representations from the /contextualized/ ones they learn.
	We then evaluate them against the semantic judgements provided by human speakers. In line with previous evidence,
	we observe a generalized advantage of multimodal representations over language-only ones on concrete word pairs,
  but not on abstract ones. On the one hand, this confirms the effectiveness of these models to
	align language and vision, which results in better semantic representations for concepts that are /grounded/ in images.
	On the other hand, models are shown to follow different representation learning patterns, which
	sheds some light on /how/ and /when/ they perform multimodal integration."

    participants: their age. While previous work showed differences at various linguistic levels between
    age groups when experimenting with written discourse data (e.g., blog posts), previous work on dialogue
    has largely been limited to acoustic information related to voice and prosody. Detecting fine-grained
    linguistic properties of human dialogues is of crucial importance for developing AI- based conversational
    systems which are able to adapt to their human interlocutors. We therefore investigate whether, and to
    what extent, current text-based NLP models can detect such linguistic differences, and what the features
    driving their predictions are. We show that models achieve a fairly good performance on age- group prediction,
    though the task appears to be more challenging compared to discourse. Through in-depth analysis of the
    best modelsâ€™ errors and the most predictive cues, we show that, in dialogue, differences among age groups
    mostly concern stylistic and lexical choices. We believe these findings can inform future work on developing
    controlled generation models for adaptive conversational systems."

    In this study, we estimate sentence information content within discourse context.
    We find that speakers transmit information at a stable rate---i.e., rationally---in English newspaper articles
    but that this rate decreases in spoken open domain and written task-oriented dialogues.
    We also observe that speakers' choices are not oriented towards local uniformity of information,
    which is another hypothesised rational strategy. We suggest that a more faithful model of communication
    should explicitly include production costs and goal-oriented rewards."

    light on how humans coordinate in conversation, but may also contribute to developing more natural and effective
    dialogue agents in education contexts related to language learning. Our approach is novel in several respects:
    We focus on multi-word constructions at the lexical and morphosyntactic level, consider both first and second
    acquisition dialogue, and contrast these setups with adult native conversation. The results of our study show
    that language acquisition scenarios are characterised by richer inventories of shared constructions but lower

We probe the learned model representations using diagnostic classifiers. Our experiments show that pretrained multimodal transformer-based architectures can perform higher-level relational reasoning, and are able to learn representations for novel tasks and data that are very different from what was seen in pretraining.",

We use distributional methods to quantify lexical semantic change and induce a social network on communities, based on interactions between members. We explore the relationship between semantic change and the clustering coefficient of a community{'}s social network graph, as well as community size and stability. While none of these factors are found to be significant on their own, we report a significant effect of their three-way interaction. We also report on significant word-level effects of frequency and change in frequency, which replicate previous findings.",

In this paper, we tackle the generation of first and subsequent references in visually grounded dialogue. We propose a generation model that produces referring utterances grounded in both the visual and the conversational context. To assess the referring effectiveness of its output, we also implement a reference resolution system. Our experiments and analyses show that the model produces better, more effective referring utterances than a model not grounded in the dialogue context, and generates subsequent references that exhibit linguistic patterns akin to humans.",

We take as our starting point a state-of-the-art image captioning system and develop several model variants that exploit information from human gaze patterns recorded during language production. In particular, we propose the first approach to image description generation where visual processing is modelled sequentially. Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production. We find that processing gaze data sequentially leads to descriptions that are better aligned to those produced by speakers, more diverse, and more natural{---}particularly when gaze is encoded with a dedicated recurrent component.",
